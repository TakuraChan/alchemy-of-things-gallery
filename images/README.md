## Photography Tips

   - Natural light (cloudy day is ideal)
   - Avoid direct sunlight (creates hotspots)
   - Use even, diffused lighting

2. **Setup:**
   - Hang painting flat on wall
   - Camera perpendicular to painting (straight on)
   - Use tripod if possible

3. **Camera Settings:**
   - Turn off flash
   - Use highest resolution
   - Take multiple shots

4. **Post-Processing:**
   - Crop to just the painting
   - Adjust brightness/contrast if needed
